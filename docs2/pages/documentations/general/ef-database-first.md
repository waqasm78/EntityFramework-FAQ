# Entity Framework - EF Database First

## What is Entity Framework Database First? 

When you start learning Entity Framework, you will also often see the term **Entity Framework Database First**. Database first is one of the three approaches to create an entity model.

## Answer

In the Entity Framework, the Database First Approach provides an alternative to the Code First by creating POCO classes from the existing database.

 - Database first approach is used when a database is ready; then Entity Framework will complete its duty and create POCO entities for you
 - If you already had a designed database and you don't want to do extra efforts, then you can go with this approach.
 - You can modify the database manually and update model from a database. 
 - So, we can say, entity framework is able to create your model classes based on tables and columns from the relational database.

## Create Model Using Database First Approach

In the [Code First](/ef-code-first), we have created a database from a DbContext and classes. 

 - It is also possible to reverse engineer an existing database into a DbContext and classes, and it is known as Database First approach.
 - We have a simple database created which contains `Books` table.

Let's create a new empty project and add the EntityFramework NuGet package which is explained in the [Code First](/ef-code-first) approach.
 
We will use of Entity Framework Designer, which is included as part of Visual Studio, to create our model.

Right click on the project in Solution Explorer and choose `Add > New Item...` option.

Select Data from the left menu and then `ADO.NET Entity Data Model`.

Enter **BookStore** as the name and click **Add**. This launches the Entity Data Model Wizard. Select **EF Designer from Database** and click **Next**.

Select the connection to the database you created in the [Code First](/ef-code-first), enter BookContext as the name of the connection string and click **Next**.

Click the checkbox next to Tables you want to import and click **Finish**.

Now let's look at the new DbContext class.

```csharp
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// <auto-generated>
//     This code was generated from a template.
//
//     Manual changes to this file may cause unexpected behavior in your application.
//     Manual changes to this file will be overwritten if the code is regenerated.
// </auto-generated>
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

namespace DatabaseFirst
{
    using System;
    using System.Data.Entity;
    using System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure;
    
    public partial class BookContext : DbContext
    {
        public BookContext()
            : base("name=BookContext")
        {
        }
    
        protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            throw new UnintentionalCodeFirstException();
        }
    
        public virtual DbSet<Book> Books { get; set; }
    }
}

```

You can see that DbSet property is created `Book` Entity class. You can now use a LINQ query to read/write from/to the database.

```csharp
using (var db = new BookContext())
{
    db.Books.Add(new Book { Title = "Introduction to Programming", Date = DateTime.Now});
    db.SaveChanges();

    foreach (var book in db.Books)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(book.Title);
    }
}
```
